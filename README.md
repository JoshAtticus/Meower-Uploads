# Meower Uploads
Meower Uploads is designed to be a high-performance files service for Meower.

Public instance hosted at: https://uploads.meower.org


### System Requirements
Meower Uploads can use a fair amount of CPU and RAM. We recommend using a fairly modern CPU, with at least 4 threads and 4GB of dedicated RAM.

Meower Uploads has only been tested on GNU/Linux. Meower Uploads uses utilities found in the [GNU core utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils).

Meower Uploads also requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to be installed and accessible.

No special codecs are required to be installed for Meower Uploads at this time, but this may change in the future.


### Integration
To integrate Meower Uploads with your existing Meower deployment, simply configure it to connect to your MongoDB database.
